This project is a new numerical method called the Matching Method for finding the root of equations.
It is a project started by Dr. Ugbor (Ph.D Mathematics) and Israel Duff (Bsc. Computer Science).
This matching method converges faster than the normal bisection method, and it's guaranteed to work better than bisection method.
give it a try.
